# Email_Spam_Detection
Project Description
In this project, we utilize Python to build an email spam detector. The main objective is to employ machine learning techniques to train the spam detector to accurately classify emails into spam and non-spam categories.

Implementation Steps
Data Preprocessing:

The email dataset is preprocessed to clean the text, remove HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords.
Tokenization and vectorization are performed to convert the text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Model Selection:

We experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Model Training:

Once the model is selected, it is trained using the preprocessed email data.
During training, the model learns the patterns and characteristics of spam and non-spam emails.
Model Evaluation:

The trained model's performance is evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate test dataset.
These metrics help assess the model's effectiveness in classifying emails into spam and non-spam categories.
Summary of Model Performance
Accuracy: The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model achieved an accuracy of approximately 98.57% on the test set, indicating its strong performance in classifying emails as spam or non-spam.

Precision: The precision score for identifying 'spam' emails was approximately 99.19%, suggesting that the model correctly identified a high proportion of actual spam emails among all emails predicted as spam.

Recall: The recall score for 'spam' emails was slightly lower at approximately 89.13%, indicating that the model missed identifying some spam emails present in the dataset. Nonetheless, the overall performance of the SVC model in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall indicates its effectiveness in identifying spam emails with high confidence while minimizing false positives.

Conclusion
Building an email spam detector using Python and machine learning techniques provides us with an effective tool to protect themselves from unwanted and potentially harmful emails. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can automatically classify emails into spam and non-spam categories, enhancing email security and user experience.
